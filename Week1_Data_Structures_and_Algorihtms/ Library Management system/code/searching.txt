Linear Search-->scans elements one by one until found or end reached.This works good for unsorted data and similar datsets

Binary Search-->Repeatedly divide a sorted list into halves.Used for large sorted datasets.Based on the concept of divide and conquer.

Time complexity-->

Linear Search:

Best Case-->O(1)
Average/Worst case-->O(n)

Binary Search:

Best Case-->O(1)
Average/Worst case-->O(log n)

Linear search should be used when list is unsorted/small and for small number of searches
Binary search should be used when list is large and sorted and repeated search and big dataset
