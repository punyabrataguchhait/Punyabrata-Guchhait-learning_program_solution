Bubble Sort--->Works by comparing adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Insertion Sort--->Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
Quick sort--->Picks a pivot and partitions the array so that elements smaller than pivot are left, larger ones right.Uses recursion for sorting pairs.


Time complexity:

Bubble Sort:
Best Case (already sorted)-->O(n)
Average & Worst Case---> O(n^2)

Quick Sort:
Best & Average Case-->O(n log n)
Worst Case--> O(nÂ²)--->bad pivot position


Bubble sort is not used in industry level projects .
While quick sort is faster for large datasets by using divide and conquer but bubble sort performs multiple swaps as input size grows.
