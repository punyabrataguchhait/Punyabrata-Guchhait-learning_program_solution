Singly Linked List--->Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Doubly Linked List-->Each node contains data and a reference to the next node and reference to the previous node.


Time Complexity:

Addition--->O(n)-->Traverse the entire linked list to insert 
Searching-->O(n)-->Linear search through the list
Deletion-->O(n)-->Linear search through the list and delete element by ID	
Display Tasks-->O(n)-->Traverse each node and print the value or data in the nodes

Advantages of Linked lists over Arrays:

-->Linked lists are dynamic in nature .They grow dynamically in size as per when required contrary to arrays which have a fixed size.
--->In arrays memory often preallocated and may lead to wastage if not used but this does not happen in linked lists.
