Add operation--->O(1)
Delete operation-->O(1)
Update operation-->O(1)

In all the above 3 operations we are dealing with one product at a time.

for viewing inventory, time complexity--->O(n)--->looping through the entire data structure linearly.(n=total number of products)

optimization steps:
for thread safe operations ConcurrentHashMap can be used,
for further optimization secondary maps can also be used
