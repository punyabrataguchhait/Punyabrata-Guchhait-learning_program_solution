Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory where each element is stored at a fixed offset.

Advantages of Arrays:
--->Fast access to elements using indices.
--->Simplicity in implementation.


Time complexity:

Add operation-->O(1)--->Appending every entry at the last available index.
Search operation--->O(n)--->Iterating linearly through the Arrays
Delete operation--->O(n)-->Linear iteraion through the array to Delete the element
Traverse--->O(n)--->Linearly iterating through the array to access every element

Limitations of Arrays:
--->Fixed size
--->Non-dynamic in nature
--->Wastage of memory if allocated memory not used

Arrays should be used:
-->When the number of elements is known and small
--->Frequent access is mandatory
--->For simple implementation
