big O notation ---> O --> this describes time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of its input size(n).

Let size of array=n

Linear Search:
Best Case-->O(1)--->Loop runs once because target item is present at first index.
Average Case-->O(n/2)--->Item occurs in the middle of array
Worst Case-->O(n)--->Last item or target item is absent

Binary Search:
Best Case-->O(1)--->Loop runs once because target item is present at first index.
Average & worst case--->O(log n)--->multiple divisions of the array to find the target item.


in real world e-commerce platforms binary Search is used.it works efficiently for millions of items and provides scalable search.
